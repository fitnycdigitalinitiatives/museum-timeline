In presenting the exhibition in celebration of our Bicentennial, we honor not only our political debt to France through the American Revolution but also French fashion industries for the inspiration given us for so many years.",poiret-king-of-fashion.png,poiret-gallery.jpg,,

Each designer, in a a separate era of the century, provided a new concept and vision of dress. They reformulate and reform dress. All three offer clothing design as a conceptual and radical enterprise. They posit ideas as they work with material; they realize a definition of woman as they create the garment. In the instances of Vionnet, McCardell, and Kawakubo, these women make clothes that make women. These three women make clothes that foster a new intelligence and new directions in apparel. Their analytical considerations of construction, of the body, and of the social role of women were and are brave and abiding ideas about fashion.",three-women.png,,,
3,The Corset: Fashioning the Body,2000-01-25,2000-04-22,"corset, valerie steele","The corset was one of the sexiest items of clothing in the history of fashion — and one of the most controversial. Like the high-heeled shoe, it is viewed as both an icon of erotic femininity and an instrument of women’s oppression. The Museum at FIT examined the social and cultural significance of the corset throughout fashion history in the exhibition The Corset: Fashioning the Body.

Curated by Valerie Steele, chief curator at The Museum at FIT, the exhibition included approximately 100 corsets and corset-inspired fashions, as well as archival photographs, posters, books, caricatures, and advertisements that document the evolution of corsetry. More than the typical display of “historic costume,” this exhibition explored the social-psychology of clothing. By showing how corsets have fashioned the ideal body and by presenting a wide variety of different kinds of corsets, the exhibition brilliantly demonstrated how the meaning of clothing is constantly being redefined.",corset.jpg,corset-l.jpg,,http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/the-corset.php
4,Madame Grès: Sphinx of Fashion,2008-02-01,2008-04-19,"madame grès, patricia mears","Madame Alix Grès (1903-1993), was one of the twentieth century’s most brilliant couturiers. During a career that spanned six decades, beginning around 1930 and lasting until 1988, she developed unique construction techniques that allowed her to craft garments of exquisite sculptural beauty. Because Grès draped each garment by hand and eschewed novel, thematic collections, her work has often been described – inaccurately – as free from the quixotic dictates of fashion. The fact is that she did keep pace with the times, but rather than merely follow general design trends, she elevated dressmaking to an art form.

Despite the high regard in which Madame Grès is held, the details of her innovations and the evolution of her distinctive style remain relatively obscure. This exhibition was the first to identify three primary styles as distinct terms in the Grès lexicon: the classically-inspired, “Grecian” style of her pleated gowns; the “ethnic” inspirations behind her simple, geometric designs; and the billowing, three-dimensional quality of her “sculptural” coats and gowns. Each original design was crafted by the couturier in solitude and draped “in the round.” Her unique, self-taught methods of construction may lack mathematical precision, but their technical consistency and graceful aesthetics come undeniably from the hand of a master couturier. This exhibition was dedicated to her incomparable achievements.",madame-gres.jpg,,,http://sites.fitnyc.edu/depts/museum/gres/
5,Gothic: Dark Glamour,2008-09-05,2009-02-21,"fantasy, gothic, valerie steele","Gothic is an epithet that evokes images of death, destruction, and decay. Such negative connotations have made the gothic an ideal symbol of rebellion for a wide range of cultural outsiders. From its origins in 18th century gothic literature of terror to its contemporary manifestations in vampire literature and cinema, the gothic has embraced the powers of horror and the erotic macabre. Throughout its history, fashion has been central to our vision of the gothic. More than 75 ensembles were on display in a theatrical mise-en-scene, suggesting iconic gothic settings, such as the labyrinth, the ruined castle and the laboratory. Although popularly identified with black-clad teenagers and rock musicians, gothic fashion was represented in this exhibition with looks by designers such as Alexander McQueen, John Galliano of Christian Dior, Rick Owens, Gareth Pugh, Anne Demeulemeester, Anna Sui, Olivier Theyskens, Ricardo Tischi of Givenchy, Jun Takahashi of Undercover, and Yohji Yamamoto, as well as sub-cultural styles, such as old-school goth, cyber-goth, and the Japanese look of Elegant Gothic Lolitas.",gothic.jpg,gothic-l.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/9QCATpazKBg,http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/gothic-dark-glamour.php
6,Seduction,2008-12-09,2009-06-16,"colleen hill, sexuality","Seduction is traditionally defined as an act of temptation and enticement, often sexual in nature. Throughout history, men and women have utilized seductive clothing to enhance physical attractiveness, as well as to convey a sense of power and social status. Seduction, the first chronological survey to explore 250 years of sexuality in fashion, examined the complex relationship between seduction and clothing, presenting a visual history of sexuality, moral standards, and social norms all observed through the prism of fashion. At least seventy looks and forty accessories were featured, including a black satin Belle Époque corset, red satin Manolo Blahnik stilettos, and a skintight black leather evening gown by John Galliano for Christian Dior.",seduction.jpg,,,http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/seduction.php
7,Isabel Toledo: Fashion from the Inside Out,2009-06-17,2009-09-26,"isabel toledo, patricia mears, ruben toledo, valerie steele","The Cuban-born fashion designer Isabel Toledo is often described as “a designer’s designer.” Although she is little known to the general public, her work is greatly admired by members of the fashion community. As the late fashion journalist Amy Spindler once wrote, “Only great designers can dispense with themes and theatrics and let the work speak instead. Ms. Toledo does just that, letting fashion itself be the theme.”",isabel-toledo.jpg,Jellyfish.jpg,,http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/isabel-toledo.php
8,Fashion & Politics,2009-07-07,200-11-07,"american, elections, jennifer farley, melissa marra-alvarez, patriotism, politics","Featuring over one hundred costumes, textiles and accessories, Fashion & Politics examined the rich history of politics in fashion. The exhibition’s introductory gallery explored the theme of American nationalism and features a woman’s costume, circa 1889, printed with an American flag motif, as well as Catherine Malandrino’s iconic Flag Dress, worn by numerous celebrities and socialites to express patriotism after 9/11, and then again in response to the 2008 elections. Also featured was an “IKE” dress from the 1956 Eisenhower Campaign, a “NIXON” paper dress, and memorabilia from the historic 2008 presidential elections.",fashion-politics.jpg,,,http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/fashion-and-politics.php
9,Eco-Fashion: Going Green,2010-05-26,2010-11-13,"colleen hill, eco-fashion, environment, evolution, jennifer farley, recycling, sustainability","Eco-Fashion: Going Green explored the evolution of the fashion industry’s multifaceted and complex relationship with the environment. By examining the past two centuries of fashions, good and bad, environmental and ethical practices, Eco-Fashion: Going Green provided historical context for today’s eco-fashion movement.

Presented chronologically and featuring more than 100 garments, accessories, and textiles, the exhibition used contemporary methods for “going green” as a framework to study the past. The objects displayed each touch upon at least one of six major themes: the re-purposing and recycling of materials, fiber origins, textile dyeing and production, quality of craftsmanship, labor practices, and the treatment of animals. Curated by Jennifer Farley and Colleen Hill, the exhibition featured some of the finest examples of 21st-century sustainable fashions by current, cutting-edge labels, including Alabama Chanin, Ciel, Edun, FIN, and NOIR.",eco-fashion.jpg,lrg_gall_ECO_006.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/VN11bag3nWY,http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/eco-fashion.php

Throughout the past 150 years of fashion history, couture copies, diffusion lines, and licensing agreements have blurred the line between what is genuine and imitation. Meanwhile, the exponential growth and sophistication of the counterfeit industry has made it increasingly difficult to identify an inauthentic item. Faking It sheds light on the complexities surrounding these topics.",faking-it.jpg,73.82.1_78.179.4_20140910_01_bckgrnd1-922x1020.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/Is9Hxn7Wr5w,http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/faking-it.php

Each city’s cultural identity and particular economic, political, and social circumstances combine to elevate its designers to international prominence. Through over 70 objects, Global Fashion Capitals explored the history of the established fashion capitals — Paris, New York, Milan, and London — followed by Tokyo and Antwerp, and the emergence of 16 new fashion cities. Global Fashion Capitals aimed to broaden the understanding of what constitutes a fashion capital and to expand the dialog on the globalization of the fashion industry during the 21st century.",global-fashion-capitals.jpg,2015.6.1_20150326_01-background-crop-3-1599x1020.jpg,,http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/global-fashion-capitals.php

The exhibition featured more than 70 objects from the museum’s permanent collection, many of which have never been on view. In addition to the history of jeans, Denim examined a variety of denim garments — from work wear to haute couture — in order to shed new light on how a particular style of woven cotton has come to dominate the clothing industry and the way people dress around the globe.",denim.jpg,denim-l.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/hFmzyUSarVY,http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/denim.php
14,Uniformity,2016-05-20,2016-11-19,"emma mcclendon, expedition, military, politics, uniforms","Uniforms are the antithesis of high fashion. Where uniform design focuses on notions of functionality, control, and tradition, fashion promotes constant change, creativity, and subversion. Yet fashion has often drawn inspiration from uniforms of all kinds, taking functional features and transforming them into decorative elements. Simultaneously designed to blend in and stand out, uniforms occupy a unique place in our society. We encounter uniforms everywhere, from those of soldiers and school children, to the distinctive attire of flight attendants and fast-food clerks. Likewise, the uniforms of athletes and police officers have become familiar, everyday sights. They are overt symbols of social order, but they are also considered so commonplace that they are often overlooked.

Uniformity explored the dynamic history behind a variety of uniforms, considering both their social role and their influence on high fashion. The exhibition was organized thematically to focus on four categories of uniforms: military, work, school, and sports. Uniformity included over 70 objects from The Museum at FIT’s permanent collection, many of which had never been on view before.",uniformity.jpg,uniformity-thom-browne-photo-by-dan-lecca-1599x1020.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OwlyDeSX7w,http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/uniformity.php
15,Black Fashion Designers,2016-12-06,2017-05-16,"african diaspora, ariele elia, diversity, elizabeth way, fashion models","Black Fashion Designers examined the impact made by designers of African descent on the world of fashion. Drawing exclusively from The Museum at FIT’s permanent collection, the exhibition featured approximately 75 fashion objects that illustrated the individual styles of more than 60 designers, placing them within a wider fashion context. Objects dated from the 1950s to the present, included mid-century evening gowns by Anne Lowe and the jovial, yet controversial, work of Patrick Kelly from the 1980s. Contemporary pieces included Lagos-based designer Maki Oh’s spring 2013 dress, which reconceptualizes Nigerian traditions, and pieces from the latest runways of established designers, such as Tracy Reese, and emerging talents, such as Charles Harbison.

The exhibition addressed the influence of black fashion models as well, by highlighting milestone events, such as “The Ebony Fashion Fair.” Black Fashion Designers was meant to enliven the conversation about historic and ongoing issues of diversity within the fashion industry. It honored the creative talents of designers who are often overlooked and provided a fresh, holistic view of the fashion industry, emphasizing the significant roles in culture and society played by black designers.",black-fashion-designers.jpg,bfd-exhibition-banner-1024x653.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/prFYr8qzPw8,http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/black-fashion-designers.php
16,Force of Nature,2017-05-30,2017-11-18,"evolution, geology, melissa marra-alvarez, nature, science","Force of Nature examined how the beauty and complexity of the natural world inspired fashion designers for centuries. The exhibition placed more than 95 objects from MFIT’s permanent collection, dating from the 18th century to the present, within a context of period philosophies and scientific literature in order to demonstrate the deep interconnectedness between fashion and nature.

A 1775 robe à l’anglaise with a naturalistic pattern of fruit and flowers, illustrated a movement towards simple dress, influenced by philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau, who urged a return to nature. A dress by Alexander McQueen from his acclaimed final collection in 2010, presented a meditation upon Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution and concern over climate change.

More than a survey of flora, fauna, and geology as merely decorative, the exhibition revealed the natural world as a nexus of ideas and symbolism in fashion design. Force of Nature aimed to contribute to today’s important, ongoing conversation about society’s relationship with the natural world and humankind’s place within it.",force-of-nature.jpg,Nature_01.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JpxQ1FThaY,http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/force-of-nature.php
17,The Body: Fashion and Physique,2017-12-05,2018-05-05,"body, emma mcclendon, femininity, physique, shape, silhouette","Fashion is inextricably linked to the physical form of the wearer. The cut of a garment draws the eye to zones of the body, simultaneously accentuating and concealing in order to achieve a desired silhouette. Elaborate undergarments, diet regimens, exercise routines, and even plastic surgery have all been promoted as necessary tools for attaining the ideal fashion shape. However, the idealized fashionable body is a cultural construct. Over the last 250 years, full hips, narrow hips, feminine waists, and boyish frames have each, at different times, been hailed as the pinnacle of beauty. According to a Vogue article from 1950, “A ‘figure’…is considered good or bad only as related to clothing generally, and current fashions specifically.” The Body: Fashion and Physique — curated by Emma McClendon — explored the complex history of the “perfect” body in fashion.

This exhibition examined the broader relationship between the fashion industry and body politics from the nineteenth century to the present. 50 objects from the collection of The Museum at FIT were on view, alongside clippings, photographs, and videos from the popular press. The Body: Fashion and Physique elucidated the impact the fashion industry has had on how people have viewed and treated their bodies throughout history. It also considered how fashion has contributed to the marginalization of certain body types within our culture.",the-body.jpg,background-v2.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZfYyXyMF4I0,http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/the-body-fashion-physique.php
18,Fashion Unraveled,2018-05-25,2018-11-17,"altered, colleen hill, deconstructed, fashion stories, unfinished","Fashion Unraveled examined the concepts of imperfection and incompletion in fashion. Garments that were altered, unfinished, or deconstructed, in addition to clothing that shows signs of wear, highlighted the aberrant beauty in flawed objects. Unless such imperfections are intentional — as they are in the case of deconstructed fashion — these garments are often overlooked in museum collections. This exhibition included a selection of objects from the museum’s permanent collection, highlighting objects that are not only visually compelling, but that may also tell intriguing stories about their makers and/or wearers.

It is only in recent years that imperfect or inauthentic objects have been given greater consideration, as interest in their “biographies” has grown. Signs of repeated wear, shortened hemlines, and careful mends can be found even on haute couture garments, and they highlight the lasting economic and emotional worth of many clothes within museum collections. These findings — which are often unseen and unknown by museum visitors — challenge the concept of fashion as a strictly ephemeral, disposable commodity. Fashion Unraveled also revealed how the appearance of aged clothing, with its flaws and signs of decay, has been embraced by many designers as an aesthetic choice, furthering the reconstruction of notions about beauty and value in fashion.",fashion-unraveled.jpg,background-image-v3-1020x1020.jpg,,http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/fashion-unraveled.php
19,"Pink: The History of a Punk, Pretty, Powerful Color",2018-09-07,2019-01-05,"color, pink, valerie steele","Pink is popularly associated with little girls, ballerinas, Barbie dolls, and all things feminine. Yet the symbolism and significance of pink have varied greatly across time and space. The stereotype of pink-for-girls versus blue-for-boys may be ubiquitous today, but it only gained traction in the mid-twentieth century. In the eighteenth century, when Madame de Pompadour helped make pink fashionable at the French court, it was perfectly appropriate for a man to wear a pink suit, just as a woman might wear a pink dress. In cultures such as India, men never stopped wearing pink.

Yet anyone studying pink comes up against “the color’s inherent ambivalence.” One of “the most divisive of colors,” pink provokes strong feelings of both “attraction and repulsion.” “Please sisters, back away from the pink,” wrote one journalist, responding to the pink pussy hats worn at the Women’s March. Some people think pink is pretty, sweet, and romantic, while others associate it with childish frivolity or flamboyant vulgarity. In recent years, however, pink has increasingly has been interpreted as cool, androgynous, and political.

Curated by Dr. Valerie Steele, director of The Museum at FIT, Pink: The History of a Punk, Pretty, Powerful Color explored the changing significance of the color pink over the past three centuries.",pink.jpg,2016.93.1-1066x1020.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/embed/GRQQs5gDTG8,
